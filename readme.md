Support Desk Trainer
====================

This was a game parody of a job I used to work at (A support desk for a university).

It was made in only a weekend, without the help of an artist, so it's not terribly high-quality. It was made with Actionscript Flash using the [Flex Sdk](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex.html), and the [Flashpunk](http://useflashpunk.net/) library.

Avaliable to play on [Kongregate](http://www.kongregate.com/games/asperous/support-desk-simulator).
